                You should charge your Electric Bike before 30%. But some believe it is necessary to charge daily or after every ride, but it is not so. Keep it in mind that when you go for a ride, your Electric Bike charging should be above 30%. If you are going for a long drive, charge your Electric Bike full first to avoid any inconvenience in your ride.
